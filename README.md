# Makeup Recommendation System

**Project Status:** In early development

This project aims to build a machine learning-powered system that recommends personalized makeup products based on a user's skin tone and undertones. Users will answer a quick quiz to determine their undertone, and the system will return suggested product categories that match their profile.

## Goals

- Analyze undertone datasets using NumPy and Pandas
- Build a classification model to map tones to product types
- Use quiz-based input to personalize recommendations
- (Planned) Integrate product APIs modeled on Sephora catalogs
- (Planned) Add real-time facial analysis using OpenCV
- (Planned) Store user results and progress using Firebase

## Technologies

- Python (core)
- NumPy, Pandas (data analysis)
- OpenCV (planned for facial analysis)
- Firebase (planned for backend)
- Product APIs (planned for recommendation matching)

## Notes

This repository currently includes planning notes and foundational scripts.  
Development is ongoing and will be updated as modules are built.
