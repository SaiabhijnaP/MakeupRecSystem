# Makeup Recommendation System – Planning Notes

## Goal
Build a system that recommends suitable makeup products (e.g., foundation, concealer) based on a user's skin tone and undertone. The system will use machine learning to classify undertones and match compatible product tones.


## Data Input
User input will be collected via a quiz to determine undertones (warm, cool, neutral).

Sample quiz questions:
- What color are the veins on your wrist?
- How does your skin react to sun exposure?
- What type of jewelry suits you better – gold or silver?
- What’s your skin’s surface tone? (fair, medium, deep)(also planning to widen this range)

## Features

### In Progress
- Undertone classification using NumPy and Pandas
- Quiz-based user input flow

### Planned
- Product mapping via mock/public APIs (based on Sephora or other)
- Real-time facial analysis using OpenCV
- User results storage and filtering using Firebase


## Tech Stack to use

- Python (core)
- NumPy, Pandas (data analysis)
- OpenCV (planned – facial tone detection)
- Firebase (planned – backend/database)
- Product APIs (planned – recommendation matching)
- (Optional) HTML/CSS for web UI if deployed


## Future Ideas

- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Add camera input for live skin tone detection
- Create a feedback/rating system for user experience
